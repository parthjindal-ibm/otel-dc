ODCL (OTel based Data Collector for LLM) is the tool or template to generate OpenTelemetry metrics for various
LLM and LLM Applications. All implementation are based on predefined OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions.

## Requirements

- Java 11+

## Build & Installation

1) Make sure Java SDK 11+ is installed.
```bash
java -version
```

2) Get the source code from `github.ibm.com`.
```bash
git clone https://github.ibm.com/instana-llmetry/otel-dc.git
cd otel-dc/llm
```

3) Build with Gradle
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```
*Note: gradle 7.4 will be installed if you do not have it.*

## Run ODCL

1) Make sure code is built with Java SDK 11+.

2) Refine configuration file (config/config.yaml) according to your own LLM application. 

3) Start up your OTLP backend which accept OTLP connections. Right now we support following protocols:
- otlp/grpc

1) Option-1: Run the Data Collector with gradle
```bash
./gradlew run
```
1) Option-2: Extract deployment package generated by gradle:
```bash
tar vxf otel-dc-llm-*.tar
cd otel-dc-llm-*
```

Then, user can create the proper configuration files:
  - config/config.yaml
  - config/logging.properties

Run the Data Collector with following command according to your current OS:
  - bin/odcl
